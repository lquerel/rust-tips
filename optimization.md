# Optimizations

## Profiling with perf + Firefox

```shell
perf record -g --call-graph dwarf ./my-binary
perf script -F +pid > ./my-file-output
```

Then visit profiler.firefox.com in an FF browser and load the file generated by the second command to see stack traces, timing diagrams, etc.

## Assembler code generated

Visit the [Godbolt compiler](https://godbolt.org) explorer site with the -O argument to turn on optimizations.
